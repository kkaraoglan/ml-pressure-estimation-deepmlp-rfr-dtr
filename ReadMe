Description:

This repository contains the implementation of machine learning models for cylinder pressure estimation in diesel engines using newly developed biodiesel-fusel oil mixtures. The models included are Deep Multi-Layer Perceptron (Deep-MLP), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and Decision Tree Regression (DTR). The goal of this work is to predict engine cylinder pressure based on various input features related to fuel composition, engine parameters, and other relevant metrics. The results show the performance of each model in both training and testing phases across different fuel types.

Feel free to clone this repository and explore the code. The provided models and code can be utilized to predict cylinder pressures in various engine configurations.
